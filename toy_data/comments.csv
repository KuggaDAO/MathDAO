It's a convenient abstraction rather than an affirmation of any 'existence' of real numbers.",35.0

Most people think quantum mechanics is pretty weird and have trouble believing it (as did Einstein, so they're in good company) so using quantum mechanics as a justification further convinces them that complex numbers are merely nonsense.",113.0

If you try to solve a cubic equation that has a real solution, sometimes you have to use complex numbers in intermediate steps in the calculation.  But then when you get to the end you find a real number that really is a solution to a real cubic equation!",8.0
